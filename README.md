# GoHighLevel MCP Server (Claude Code Compatible Fork)

This is a customized deployment of the [original GoHighLevel MCP Server](https://github.com/mastanley13/GoHighLevel-MCP), adapted specifically for Claude Code and ChatGPT integrations.

> ðŸ›  This fork replaces the original Vercel function-based deployment with a Render-hosted server using a standalone Node.js `server.js`. It maintains full MCP compatibility with Claude Code.
